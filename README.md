# The-daily-prophet
An AR chromakey based newspaper. Require Unity, Vuforia and a smarthpone visor for stereoscopic view.

Inside the ARPrototype folder, there are 2 .apk file as well as the marker I've used.
This will allow you to test my prototype before opening Unity.
Feel free to use my marker or to create your own according to your needs.

Add your Vuforia license and target images.
The two cameras have 2 different functions:
  - the first one will use the chroma key;
  - the second one will display the AR image below your hands.
  
  Change the position of the AR buttons to the best point in your own marker image.
  
  
  LAST UPDATE: January 2019.
  UNITY VERSION: 2018.2
